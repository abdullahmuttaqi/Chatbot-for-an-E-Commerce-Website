# Chatbot-for-an-E-Commerce-Website

I’ve built my own intelligent chatbot to make online experiences easier and more convenient for users. It’s not just fast and reliable—it’s also available 24/7, ensuring support is always just a message away.
Whether a visitor is browsing my website or searching for specific products, the chatbot instantly provides all the relevant details. It tells users how many pieces are available, which colors are in stock, what sizes are offered, and much more. Everything that’s listed on the website is at the user’s fingertips—without having to scroll or search manually.
Even better, the chatbot shares direct links to the exact product pages, so users can go straight to what they’re looking for with just one click.
For example, if someone asks about “shoes,” the chatbot responds immediately with detailed information and a direct product link—no hassle, no delay. And since it's fully built into the website, it creates a seamless, smooth experience from start to finish
